Audiobook Creator is an open-source project designed to convert books in various text formats (e.g., EPUB, PDF, etc.) into fully voiced audiobooks with intelligent character voice attribution. It leverages modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies to create an engaging and dynamic audiobook experience. The project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPL-3.0), ensuring that it remains free and open for everyone to use, modify, and distribute.

<details>
<summary>The project consists of three main components:</summary>

1. **Text Cleaning and Formatting (`book_to_txt.py`)**:

   - Extracts and cleans text from a book file (e.g., `book.epub`).
   - Normalizes special characters, fixes line breaks, and corrects formatting issues such as unterminated quotes or incomplete lines.
   - Extracts the main content between specified markers (e.g., "PROLOGUE" and "ABOUT THE AUTHOR").
   - Outputs the cleaned text to `converted_book.txt`.

2. **Character Identification and Metadata Generation (`identify_characters_and_output_book_to_jsonl.py`)**:

   - Identifies characters in the text using Named Entity Recognition (NER) with the GLiNER model.
   - Assigns gender and age scores to characters using an LLM via an OpenAI-compatible API.
   - Outputs two files:
     - `speaker_attributed_book.jsonl`: Each line of text annotated with the identified speaker.
     - `character_gender_map.json`: Metadata about characters, including name, age, gender, and gender score.

3. **Audiobook Generation (`generate_audiobook.py`)**:
   - Converts the cleaned text (`converted_book.txt`) or speaker-attributed text (`speaker_attributed_book.jsonl`) into an audiobook using your choice of TTS models:
     - **Kokoro TTS** ([Hexgrad/Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M)) - High-quality, fast TTS with multiple voices
     - **Orpheus TTS** ([Orpheus-FastAPI](https://github.com/Lex-au/Orpheus-FastAPI)) - High-performance TTS with emotion tags, 8 voices, and OpenAI-compatible API
   - Offers two narration modes:
     - **Single-Voice**: Uses a single voice for narration and another voice for dialogues for the entire book.
     - **Multi-Voice**: Assigns different voices to characters based on their gender scores.
   - Saves the audiobook in the selected output format to `generated_audiobooks/audiobook.{output_format}`.

## Get Started

### Initial Setup

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Make sure host networking is enabled in your docker setup : https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/. Host networking is currently supported in Linux and in docker desktop. To use with [docker desktop, follow these steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/host/#docker-desktop)
- Set up your LLM and expose an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (e.g., using LM Studio with `qwen3-14b`).
- **Choose and set up your TTS service** (one of the following):

  **Option A: Kokoro TTS** via [Kokoro-FastAPI](https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI). To get started, run the docker image using the following command:

  For CUDA based GPU inference (Apple Silicon GPUs currently not supported, use CPU based inference instead). Choose the value of MAX_PARALLEL_REQUESTS_BATCH_SIZE based on [this guide](https://github.com/prakharsr/audiobook-creator/?tab=readme-ov-file#parallel-batch-inferencing-of-audio-for-faster-audio-generation)

  ```bash
  docker run \
   --name service \
   --restart always \
   --network host \
   --gpus all \
   ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-gpu:v0.2.2    
   uvicorn api.src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8880 --log-level debug \
   --workers {MAX_PARALLEL_REQUESTS_BATCH_SIZE}
  ```

  For CPU based inference. In this case you can keep number of workers as 1 as only mostly GPU based inferencing benefits from parallel workers and batch requests.

  ```bash
  docker run \
   --name service \
   --restart always \
   --network host \
   ghcr.io/remsky/kokoro-fastapi-cpu:v0.2.2 \
   uvicorn api.src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8880 --log-level debug \
   --workers 1
  ```

  **Option B: Orpheus TTS** via [Orpheus-FastAPI](https://github.com/Lex-au/Orpheus-FastAPI). Orpheus offers high-performance TTS with emotion tags and 8 different voices. To get started:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Lex-au/Orpheus-FastAPI.git
  cd Orpheus-FastAPI

  # For GPU inference
  docker-compose -f docker-compose-gpu.yml up

  # For CPU inference
  docker-compose -f docker-compose-cpu.yaml up
  ```

  This will start the Orpheus TTS service on port 5005. Make sure to update your `.env` file accordingly:

  ```
  BASE_URL=http://localhost:5005/v1
  ```

- Create a .env file from .env_sample and configure it with the correct values. Make sure you follow the instructions mentioned at the top of .env_sample to avoid errors.
  ```bash
  cp .env_sample .env
  ```
- After this, choose between the below options for the next step to run the audiobook creator app:

   <summary>Quick Start (docker compose)</summary>

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/getfit-us/audiobook-creator-v2.git

    cd audiobook-creator
    ```

  - Make sure your .env is configured correctly and your LLM is running
  - **Optional TTS Services**: You can optionally include TTS services in your docker-compose setup:
    - To include **Kokoro TTS**: Use `docker compose --profile kokoro up --build`
    - To run **without any TTS service** (if you're running TTS separately): Use `docker compose up --build`
  - Copy the .env file into the audiobook-creator folder
  - Choose between the types of inference:

    For CUDA based GPU inference (Apple Silicon GPUs currently not supported, use CPU based inference instead). Choose the value of MAX_PARALLEL_REQUESTS_BATCH_SIZE based on [this guide](https://github.com/prakharsr/audiobook-creator/?tab=readme-ov-file#parallel-batch-inferencing-of-audio-for-faster-audio-generation) and set the value in fastapi service and env variable.

    ```bash
    cd docker/gpu

    # To include Kokoro TTS service
    docker compose -f docker-compose-kokoro.yml up

    # To run without TTS service (if using external TTS)
    docker compose -f docker-compose-external.yml up
    ```

    For CPU based inference. In this case you can keep number of workers as 1 as only mostly GPU based inferencing benefits from parallel workers and batch requests.

    ```bash
    cd docker/cpu

    # To include Kokoro TTS service
    docker compose --profile kokoro up --build

    # To run without TTS service (if using external TTS)
    docker compose up --build
    ```

  - Wait for the models to download and then navigate to http://localhost:7860 for the Gradio UI

### TTS Service Options

This audiobook creator supports multiple TTS (Text-to-Speech) services:

**Kokoro TTS** ([Kokoro-FastAPI](https://github.com/remsky/Kokoro-FastAPI))

- High-quality, fast TTS with multiple voices
- Excellent for quick audiobook generation
- Default port: 8880

**Orpheus TTS** ([Orpheus-FastAPI](https://github.com/Lex-au/Orpheus-FastAPI))

- High-performance TTS with emotion tags
- 8 different voices with emotional expressions
- Optimized for RTX GPUs
- Default port: 5005

You can choose either service based on your preferences. Both are compatible with the audiobook creator and offer OpenAI-compatible APIs.

### Parallel batch inferencing of audio for faster audio generation

- Choose the value of **MAX_PARALLEL_REQUESTS_BATCH_SIZE** based on your available VRAM to accelerate the generation of audio by using parallel batch inferencing. This variable is used while setting up the number of workers in the TTS docker container and as an env variable for defining the max number of parallel requests that can be made to the TTS service, so make sure you set the same values for both of them. You can consider setting this value to your available (VRAM/ 2) and play around with the value to see if it works best. If you are unsure then a good starting point for this value can be a value of 2. If you face issues of running out of memory then consider lowering the value for both workers and for the env variable.

## Roadmap

Planned future enhancements:

- ⏳ Add support for choosing between various languages which are currently supported by Kokoro.
- ✅ Add UI Configuration for all LLM, TTS endpoints (allows for quick changes without modifying files)
